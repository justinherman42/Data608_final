## Overview

This dashbaord is meant to accompany a capstone project my classmates and I collaborated on for our CUNY SPS Data Science Graduate Program. My group members were Vikas Sinha and Meaghan Burke. The project attempts to explore Bias in the media through an NLP analysis of major US news publications. Our focus was on how the media may present diverging coverage of the 2020 democratic primary field. We thought the primaries presented a unique  oppurtunity to explore bias, as it divorces coverage from the typcial left right dicothomy.  Can we discover how  left leaning publications may attempt to weigh the scales in their preferred direction? If so, how does that bias express itself? 



## Publications Explored

A sentiment score was developed for individual mentions of select candidates in publications spanning the political spectrum.  The overall sentiment or bias score, was the ratio of positive to negative sentiments. A sentiment was defined as a single sentence that mentioned the candidate exclusively. More details on the development of the bias score can be found in the methodolgy section. The publications explored were as follows: 

+ The New York Times
+ The Washington post
+ The Wall Street Journal
+ New York Magazine
+ MSNBC
+ Google News
+ Fox News
+ CNN
+ Breitbart News
